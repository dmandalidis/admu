1. INTRODUCTION

Admu is a very simple addressbook manager written in Perl. 
Although mutt can store e-mail addresses and names in an alias file, I prefer
keeping my address book in an MUA-independent format. This manager -although is
written especially for mutt- can be used with other MUAs with success (pine,
elm, etc) because it works only with command line arguments. 

2. INSTALL

Just follow the steps bellow :

STEP 1 : gzip -dc admu-0.2.tar.gz | tar xf - (among others)
STEP 2 : cd admu-0.2
STEP 3 : cp admu /usr/local/bin
STEP 4 : In .muttrc (or Muttrc) : set query command="admu -s %s"

There is one more optional step; You can set ADMU environment variable which
points to your address book e.g. export ADMU="/home/dm/addressbook". Otherwise 
admu will 'select' as addressbook location the path $HOME/addrbook.

3. USAGE
3.1 ADD

By specifying the '-a' argument, admu reads from standard input until it finds a
line which starts with 'From'. Then it tries to identify the line format and
finally stores two fields in your address book; an e-mail and a nickname (or
real name) separated by tabs. Instead of this, you can pipe a message from mutt
to admu -a ('|') and it will take care of this.

3.2 SEARCH

By specifying the '-s' argument followed by a string, admu will open your
address book searching for the string you queried it. Then it will store the
results (if any) in an array, it will print a status message and finally the
results (if any). Again instead of this you can press 'Q' inside the compose
menu of mutt, and admu will take care of this for you :-)

Many thanks to Lucas Maneos, who helped me a lot with suggestions 
(among other topics).
Furthermore if you have a pilot or palmtop, go grab Lucas's script from

query.
