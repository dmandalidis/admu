0.2 :

- pod format included in the script instead of a separate troff doc.
- more readable code :-) (yes, I read perlstyle(1)).
- more proper exit codes.
- just one open() call and just one close().
- catching an exception when &main::add tries to write to a full partition/a
  unreachable host etc.
- &main::search now counts matching and addressbook entries.
- now uses a default location for address book, if $ENV{"ADMU"} is not set.
